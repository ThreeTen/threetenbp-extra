/**
 * A clock that provides the current UTC or TAI instant.
 * <p>
 * This clock differs from {@link Clock} in providing access to the current instant
 * in the UTC and TAI time-scales. However, there is currently no implementation that
 * provides accurate UTC or TAI.
 *
 * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The principal methods are defined to allow the throwing of an exception.
 * In normal use, no exceptions will be thrown, however one possible implementation would be to
 * obtain the time from a central time server across the network. Obviously, in this case the
 * lookup could fail, and so the method is permitted to throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * Subclass implementations should implement {@code Serializable} wherever possible.
 * They should also be immutable and thread-safe, implementing {@code equals()},
 * {@code hashCode()} and {@code toString()} based on their state.
